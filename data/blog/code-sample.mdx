summary: How I managed to secure every single ticket to one of the biggest DJ's in the world

Please note botting tickets is a very grey area and can become a legal issue, the following all happened within the laws of the Victorian Government and all the code provided below is only for educational purposes, I highly advise against using any of it.

## Who is Fred Again?

Fred again is one of the hottest DJ's and producers at the moment, with over 2 million followers on instagram 14 million monthly listeners on spotify. Early this year Fred again was touring Australia with the Laneway Festival. Alongside his performances at Laneway he also held various sideshows at multiple locations. On Feburary 3rd he announced that he would be doing a sideshow and all his fans where going nuts for tickets. Only around 30 minutes before the actual event I was notified that the tickets would be super limited and there would be a massive amount of people trying to get them and thus would have quite high resell value (please keep in mind that reselling these tickets is completely legal as the Victorian laws only apply to events that are deemed major events by the government).

## What I did

At the time I was currently in Melbourne and had a flight in about 2 hours, with not much to do I had a look at the event and thought about maybe grabbing a ticket or two. With my background in sneaker bots it was only second nature to have a look at how the site worked. After only a few minutes of digging around I noticed a few major issues. First there was absolutely 0 bot protection or mitigation, and there was an 8 minute cart hold when you went to checkout. In about 5 minutes I created a test script to create cart holds for tickets on the site and doing a bit more looking I was able to find everything I needed to pre run the tickets. Five seconds before the drop I started my scripts, I hit a lot. I knew I hit a lot but I didn't realise that I had actually secured every single ticket in an 8 minute cart hold. I spent the next 30 minutes recarting and distributing all the carts to people from the discord until there was none left.

I didn't think much of it at the time but when I got off my flight I got a message from a friend saying that Channel 7 News had done a story about Fred Again, You can view that story uploaded onto YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv4TLOs_q20).
